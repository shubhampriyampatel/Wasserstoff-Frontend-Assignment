## Understanding the Approach

I started with the smaller task first which has high reusability like the navbar and footer UI. After this, I completed the third page with bubble data visualization statically after that I convert it to dynamically integrated UI with all timeline as well as the zoom in and zoomout features.

And, for the map I tried in lots of way but not able to implement as given in figma file.

Firstly I Understood the layout of the project task UI

Set up your development environment

Break down project UI into smaller, reusable components.

Identify the components that will have state and which ones will be stateless.

Write code for each component, using JSX syntax to describe how they should look and behave.

During the assignment I learned a lot of libraries that I never explore before and the data visualization through d3.js which is very vast.
